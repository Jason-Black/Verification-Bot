- `styles.css`: CSS file for styling.
- `script.js`: JavaScript file for logic and functionality.
- `ffmpeg/ffmpeg.min.js`: FFmpeg.js library for audio processing.

## Usage

1. **Embed Data**:
   - Select an audio file.
   - Enter the data to embed.
   - Enter a fingerprint number.
   - Click "Embed Data" to embed the data and fingerprint into the audio file.
   - The modified audio will be played, and you can optionally save it.

2. **Extract Data**:
   - Select an audio file with embedded data.
   - Click "Extract Data" to extract and display the embedded data and fingerprint.
